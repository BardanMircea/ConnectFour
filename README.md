# ConnectFour

Connect Four is a game in which two players take turns dropping red or yellow colored discs into a vertically suspended 7 x 6 grid.
Discs fall to the bottom of the grid, occupying the next available space.

A player wins by connecting four of their discs horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

This is a small Connect Four program, that allows two people to play the game.

The game will work as follows:

We start out with an empty grid.
We will display that grid to players.
Players will take turns giving their move.
At each turn, we'll check if we have reached a winning condition or a draw. 
If not, we'll keep playing.
