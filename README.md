# ConnectFour

Connect Four is a game in which two players take turns dropping red or yellow colored discs into a vertically suspended 7 x 6 grid.
Discs fall to the bottom of the grid, occupying the next available space.

A player wins by connecting four of their discs horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

I will code a small Connect Four program, that allows two people to play the game!

To do so, we need several things:

We need a grid -> we will create a 2D array that starts out empty
We will display that grid to players
Players will take turns giving their move
At each turn, we'll check if we have reached a winning condition or a draw. If not, we'll keep playing.
